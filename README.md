# KY Law Scraper

This is a partially completed effort to write a scraper and parser for KRS and louisville Code for inclusion in the State Decoded project. 

## Status

There are currently some rough edges, pdf parsing is not the easiest thing to do. I need to think about easier ways to verify the correctness of this information. 

For now the scraper works for the state, and you can download all of the pdfs of state statutes, and you can get at least 3/4 of the laws in a parsed/xml form.
